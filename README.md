Dicy2 plugin for Ableton Live
=============================

**Dicy2** is both a [package for Max](https://github.com/DYCI2/Dicy2) and a [device for Ableton Live](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/dicy2-for-live/) implementing interactive agents using machine-learning to generate musical sequences that can be integrated into musical situations ranging from the production of structured material within a compositional process to the design of autonomous agents for improvised interaction. This page is dedicated to the device for Ableton Live.

Getting Started
---------------

### Requirements

*   Mac OS >= High Sierra
*   Ableton Live >= 11. To use this plug-in developed with Max For Live, you must have Ableton Live Suite or Ableton Live Standard + the Max For Live extension.

### Installation

*   Download the last ["Dicy2 for Live" release](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/releases/dicy2-for-live/).
*   Drag the Ableton Live session embedding the device somewhere in your Ableton Live path (e.g. in "Music/Ableton/User Library") and/or the objects in "Music/Ableton/User Library/Presets/Audio Effects".

### Quick start

*   See the "Dicy2 for Ableton Live user guide" that comes with the plugin.

### Artistic collaborations

Dicy2 integrates scientific and musical research results accumulated through productions and experiments with Rémi Fox, Steve Lehman, the Orchestre National de Jazz, Alexandros Markeas, Pascal Dusapin, Le Fresnoy - Studio National des Arts Contemporains, Vir Andres Hera, Gaëtan Robillard, Benoît Delbecq, Jozef Dumoulin, Ashley Slater, Hervé Sellin, Rodolphe Burger, Marta Gentilucci... After having evolved research prototypes crystallizing the contributions of these various projects for several years, a collaborative work carried out during the year 2022 has led to the finalization of a release of Dicy2 as a [plugin for Ableton Live](https://forum.ircam.fr/projects/detail/dicy2-for-live/) and a [library for Max](https://github.com/DYCI2/Dicy2).

### Dicy2 tutorials and examples

This distribution includes agents and sound files from past productions with our friends and collaborating musicians and composers who helped bring Dicy2 to life (courtesy of the artists). Please do not use these agents and files in any context other than these tutorials to respect their work and generosity.

"Doublebass\_Perrot\_Fox.wav, Guitar\_Caillou\_Fox.wav, and Voice\_Daumergue\_Fox.wav" were respectively recorded by Alex Perrot, Thomas Caillou, and Manu Daumergue during Rémi Fox's residency at Ircam for the concerts and first album of "C'est pour ça". "Balafon\_Lehman\_ExMachina.wav" was recorded by Steve Lehman for "Ex Machina" with "Orchestre National de Jazz". "Fox\_Sax\_1/2/3.aif" come from a performance of "C'est pour ça" at Ircam.
